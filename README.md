This app will return a formatted list of movie show times.

To return a printed list of movie show times to the console, run `ruby movie_scheduler.rb <your_file>.txt`

Example:
```
ruby movie_scheduler input.txt
```

Schedule configurations are in `movie_scheduler/configuration.rb`.
Theater configurations --such as setup_time  or interval between movies-- are in `movie_schedule/theater.rb`.
